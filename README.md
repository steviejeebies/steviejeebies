Hi there!

My name is Stephen Rowe and I am an Computer Science MSc student in Trinity College Dublin. I am in my 5th year of study, and aim to earn my Master's Degree and graduate in 2023.

Please take a peek around my GitHub repositories to see some projects I have worked on. Technologies used include Java (networking, JUnit testing), C (incl. OpenMP Concurrency), Javascript (React, NodeJS, Express, HTML), Haskell, VHDL, SQL, plus many more. Also check out my short research paper on zk-SNARK technology.

If you'd like to get in touch, send me an email at rowes{:at:}tcd{:dot:}ie, it's the easiest way to get me.
